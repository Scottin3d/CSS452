# MP1 - Working with Primitives  

## Objective  
In this programming assignment we will familiarize ourselves with the programming environment, JavaScript
programming language, our IDE, AND, develop a vertical slice through the existing engine building simple
drawing functionality from the user program all the way to the GPU. The goals are for us to feel comfortable
working with the source code system, to have a better understanding of the Engine source code as provided, and
to verify our understanding of the GPU interface.  

Though relatively straightforward, dealing with the strangeness of JavaScript, the many different source code
files, and the many new technologies can be confusing and intimidating at times. Please do start early and bring
questions to class! The number of lines of code you need to write is actually relatively small (probably around
100-lines of code). However, instead of developing your own solution, you have to modify and insert your
changes into an existing system. This provides you with a flavor for the kinds of work we do in this class. Very
quickly programming assignments will demand you to modify a non-trivial game engine consisting of 10â€™s of
files and hundreds and thousands of lines of code.  

## Assignment Specifications
Here are the details of what you need to support:  
1. Triangle: the simplest shape with an area  
2. Circle: arguably the most general convex shape  
3. Transformed and instances: seeing multiple instances of each of the shapes, with different dimensions
