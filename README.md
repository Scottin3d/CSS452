# CSS452  
This class studies the technical fundamentals and the implementation of a 2D game engine from two important aspects: programmability and maintainability. 
Relevant concepts from software engineering, computer graphics, mathematics, physics, user interface, and game development will be presented in the context of game engine architecture, world coordinate system specification, object behaviors and interactions, camera manipulations, illumination, and game physics. 
The coverage of each topic will be coupled with the analysis of sample implementation source code and students will be challenged to extend the provided functionality. 
Beginning from scratch, the implementation of the concepts continuously build upon preceding results based on a software architecture that facilitates programmability by game developers supports maintainability which enables code reuse, ongoing system upkeep, improvement, and expansion.  

# MP1 Working with Primitives  
## Objective  
In this programming assignment we will familiarize ourselves with the programming environment, JavaScript programming language, our IDE, AND, develop a vertical slice through the existing engine building simple drawing functionality from the user program all the way to the GPU. 
The goals are for us to feel comfortable working with the source code system, to have a better understanding of the Engine source code as provided, and to verify our understanding of the GPU interface.  
Though relatively straightforward, dealing with the strangeness of JavaScript, the many different source code files, and the many new technologies can be confusing and intimidating at times. Please do start early and bring questions to class! 
The number of lines of code you need to write is actually relatively small (probably around 100-lines of code). However, instead of developing your own solution, you have to modify and insert your changes into an existing system. 
This provides you with a flavor for the kinds of work we do in this class. 
Very quickly programming assignments will demand you to modify a non-trivial game engine consisting of 10â€™s of files and hundreds and thousands of lines of code.  

# MP2 Game Loop and timing  
## Objective  
In this programming assignment we will develop a little depth of understanding of the provided API while involving the user and working with the inner-most component: the game loop.  
In addition to solving the specified challenges, make sure you have an absolutely and thorough understanding of every single file in your solution. Remember, complexity will increase very rapidly.  

# MP3 Resource Management and Scenes
## Objective  
In this programming assignment we will work in real-time environment, input from a JSON scene file (another popular format), and verify our understanding of viewport, and WC space.
